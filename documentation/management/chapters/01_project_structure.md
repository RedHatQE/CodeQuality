## Project Structure

To base our goal, let's assume we have the following project structure:
![Project Structure](../res/project-structure.mm.png)
as we can see, we have a single project holding two **major versions**, each with multiple **minor versions**, comprised of several **builds**.
![Project Aggregation](../res/project-aggregation.mm.png)
Because SonarQube enables version trending within it's Project items, we recommend creating a Project item for each minor version, thus each Project item will aggregate changing builds.

### Project Unique Key

SonarQube projects are being generated by running SonarScanner against your code base and assigning the analysis a unique key. **Key's are required to follow the form:**
```shell
<project-identifier>_<major_version>_<minor_version>_<language>_<coverage|static|full-analysis>
```
for example:
```shell
satellite_6_2_foreman_ruby_coverage
```
![Project dashboard](../res/sonar-project-dashboard.png)

> ⚔ Note: In the example above, key parameter is highlighted in **red** but the **blue** parameter is the project **dashboard display name** parameter, not to be confused.

> ⚔ Note: For more information on SonarQube publishing see the [Documentation section in the Code Coverage & Analysis Overview](https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=44543267#CodeCoverage&Analysis-Documentation) for language specific implementations under Dynamic Analysis.

### Project Tagging

Project tags allow you to categorize and group projects for easier selection on the Projects page. Project tags can be administered from the project home page. Administrators will see a dropdown menu indicator next to the project's list of current tags (or next to the **No tags** indicator). If the tag you want isn't visible in the dropdown, use the built in **Search** input to find what you're looking for or create it on the fly.

> ⚔ Note: If you're tag does not already exist, by typing the name of your requested tag, a '+' sign would appear to indicate the creation of a new one.

Each SonarQube project **is required to be tagged with the following:**

- Project name
- Component hierarchy

so if for example, your project is the engine component under the oVirt project in the RHV roject, version 3.5 then you'd specify:
```shell
rhv, rhv3.5, ovirt, engine
```
