## PQI recommendation

After we've centralized and normalized the quality data, we are proposing the following data visualizations to give the most objective and honest depiction on the state of a product's code quality index for each hierarchical tier as seen by CCI field experts.

These are:

* **Coverage to LOC(Lines of Code) ratio** - Gives a general indicator the the amount of attention given to test the product, although without static analysis, does not provide an assurance on quality of testing.
* **Major versions barchart** - Provides an estimate in the improvement of product tests while progressing through major architecture changes over a product's history
* **Coverage vs LOC treemap** - Is a very effective tool to help target hotspots and weakspots in a code's testing priorities
* **Coverage histogram** - Not only it provides a trend of a products quality value but by comparing it to the enterprises average code quality index as well as it's gate, we can give an honest evaluation of a product in comparison to the company's moving standard.
